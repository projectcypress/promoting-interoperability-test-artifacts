    "Each tab includes the Promoting Interoperability measure.",

    "Where CMS allows for providers to include or exclude certain data, health IT developers must demonstrate the ability to record the denominator and numerator with and without the data (i.e. ePrescribing allows for the inclusion or exclusion of controlled substances).",
    "Measures that are no longer included in the Promoting Interoperability programs will not be tested and therefore do not have test data.",
    "If a Health IT Module performs a function automatically, such as making the patient education materials available electronically once identified, or automatically making data available to a patient via view, download, transmit, or an API, it is at the ONC-ATL's discretion not to test scenarios that assume this functionality is not automatic.",
    "For Promoting Interoperability Measures, CMS clarified that a numerator is not constrained to an EHR reporting period when the EHR reporting period is less than one year. The numerator action may reasonably fall outside the EHR reporting period timeframe but must take place no earlier than the start of the calendar year and no later than the end of the calendar year in order for the patients to be counted in the numerator. As such, actions occurring after the end of the reporting period's calendar year will not count in the numerator. For applicable measures, the test data has been built to verify that a Health IT Module can record the numerator correctly for each scenario.",
    "Starting in 2019, a Promoting Interoperability Measure numerator and denominator is constrained to the performance period chosen, with the exception of the Security Risk Analysis measure which may occur any time during the calendar year.",
    "For the EC Individual and Group calculation methods, actions that accrue to the numerator have a transitive effect across all of the TINs that an individual NPI is included in.  This transitive effect applies to measures that are unique patient based: Required Tests 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5, and 6.",
    "Provider 1 is considered one unique NPI and Provider 2 is considered one unique NPI.  Group/TIN A is calculated by adding together TIN A/Provider 1 and TIN A/Provider 2.  Group/TIN B is calculated by adding together TIN B/Provider 1 and TIN B/Provider 2.  Note that for the unique patient measures, patients must be deduplicated when adding together for Group/TIN A and Group/TIN B."
