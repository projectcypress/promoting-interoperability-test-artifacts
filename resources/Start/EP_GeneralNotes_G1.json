    "Where CMS allows for providers to include or exclude certain data, health IT developers must demonstrate the ability to record the denominator  and numerator with or without the data (i.e. ePrescribing allows for the inclusion or exclusion of controlled substances).",
    "Measures that are no longer included in the Promoting Interoperability programs will not be tested and therefore do not have test data.",
    "If a Health IT Module performs a function automatically, such as making the patient education materials available electronically once identified, or automatically making data available to a patient via view, download, transmit, or an API, it is at the ATL's discretion not to test scenarios that assume this functionality is not automatic.",
    "For Promoting Interoperability Measures, CMS clarified that a numerator is not constrained to an EHR reporting period when the EHR reporting period is less than one year.  The numerator action may reasonably fall outside the EHR reporting period timeframe but must take place no earlier than the start of the calendar year and no later than the end of the calendar year in order for the patients to be counted in the numerator.  As such, actions occurring after the end of the reporting period's calendar year will not count in the numerator.  For applicable measures, the test data has been built to verify that a Health IT Module can record the numerator correctly for each scenario.",
    "Starting in 2019, a Promoting Interoperability Measure numerator and denominator is constrained to the performance period chosen, with the exception of the Security Risk Analysis measure which may occur any time during the calendar year."
